function [x,y] = MetP2V(s,d)%---------------------------------------------------------------------------%function [x,y] = MetP2V(s,d)%METP2V - convert met speed and direction to true vector components%Wind vectors can be reported in meteorological convention or %  oceanographic convention which means the vector points in the direction the wind is coming from,% or in the direction the wind is going, respectively.% The convention we use here is that meteorological winds in POLAR coordinates are%reported as speed and the direction the wind is coming from.%The components of the wind, the wind vector, are the components of the%vector and thus are in the direction the wind is going.  A true vector%sense.%INPUT% s = speed% d = direction (met convention, from direction, 0 deg = North, 90 deg = E)%OUTPUT% x,y are vector components, x = east, y = north, TO direction%%reynolds 970730%---------------------------------------------------------------------------d2r = pi / 180;x = - s .* sin(d2r * d);y = -s  .* cos(d2r * d);return
